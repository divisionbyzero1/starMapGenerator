# starMapGenerator
The class file and example script utilize the GURPS First In rules to generate a boat-load of systems for a Traveller game.

# Why do it this way?
This set of routines was created so that one could literally draw an image of stellar densities and have the program populate it with procedural worlds.  It works!  The light and dark regions of the input maps correspond to sparse/rift to dense stellar areas.  After that, all of the system generation generally follows the GURPS First In rules.
